			<p> Hi! I'm Nicholas Tran. Currently, I am a senior and love working with software. I've been very interested in this profession since high school, and
                continuing my journey towards the end of college, I have been a part of projects that have changed my perspective of how 
                impactful software engineers can be. For example, working with medical data to satellite imagery, the scope of what I thought 
                a software engineer could do has broadened.
            </p>

            <p> Throughout my time at University of California, San Diego, I have been given many opportunities to grow regarding the courses
                I take, ranging from Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Design, and Discrete Mathematics to 3D Graphics, Databases, and Machine Learning.
                Most importantly, being able to implement the knowledge I gained from these courses into real world applications solidified 
                my continuously-growing passion in this field.
            </p>
